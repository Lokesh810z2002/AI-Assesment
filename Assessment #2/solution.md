# Intelligent Queue Management System Solution

## 1. Problem Breakdown: Logical Components & Steps

### Doctor Schedules & Availability
- Track individual doctors' schedules based on their 3-hour blocks
- Monitor real-time availability and current patient status
- Consider doctors who track patient status and those who don't
- Collect and analyze historical data on consultation durations

### Patient Management
- Registration system for appointments from multiple channels (IVR, app, WhatsApp)
- Check-in process to record actual arrival times vs. scheduled times
- Priority-based queue that considers urgency, punctuality, and source
- Walk-in integration with dynamic reprioritization

### Queue Optimization
- Algorithm to match patients with the most appropriate doctor
- Dynamic queue adjustments based on wait times and urgency
- Auto-rebalancing when doctors fall behind or finish early
- Predictive wait time calculations

### Communication System
- Real-time wait time notifications to patients
- Option to reschedule if wait times exceed thresholds
- Check-in and ready-to-see notifications
- Feedback collection mechanism

### Performance Tracking
- Metrics collection on wait times, doctor utilization, patient satisfaction
- Queue efficiency scoring
- Analytics dashboard for administrators

## 2. Information Required for Intelligent Queuing

### Doctor-Related Information
- Complete schedule of each doctor's availability blocks
- Average consultation duration per doctor (tracked and updated over time)
- Current queue length and estimated completion time
- Specialization or patient type preferences
- Whether the doctor tracks patient status or not

### Patient-Related Information
- Scheduled appointment time
- Actual arrival time
- Appointment source (App, IVR, WhatsApp, walk-in)
- Medical urgency level (1-5 scale)
- Current status (registered, arrived, waiting, consulting, completed)
- Wait time so far

### System-Level Information
- Historical patterns of patient arrivals
- Peak load times during the day
- No-show rates and typical delays
- Satisfaction scores correlated with wait times
- Queue lengths throughout the day

## 3. Measuring System Effectiveness

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Average Wait Time**: Compare before vs. after implementation across different times of day
- **Queue Efficiency Score**: Number of patients served per doctor per time block compared to capacity
- **Doctor Utilization Rate**: Percentage of time doctors are actively consulting vs. idle
- **Patient Satisfaction Metrics**: Collected via app/SMS after appointments (scale of 1-5)
- **Appointment Adherence**: Percentage of patients arriving within 15 minutes of scheduled time 

### Operational Metrics
- **Walk-in Accommodation Rate**: Percentage of walk-ins successfully served same-day
- **Queue Balance Factor**: Deviation in wait times across different doctors
- **Communication Effectiveness**: Percentage of patients responding to notifications
- **Reschedule Offer Acceptance**: When patients are offered to reschedule due to long waits

## 4. Patient Communication Strategy

### Real-time Wait Time Updates
- Initial estimate provided at check-in
- SMS/App notifications when estimates change significantly (>15 minutes)
- Updated estimates every 30 minutes for waiting patients

### Queue Position Notifications
- Inform patients of their position in the queue
- Notify when they are next in line (approximately 10 minutes before seeing doctor)
- Allow patients to temporarily step out if wait is long

### Rescheduling Options
- Proactive offering of rescheduling if wait exceeds 45 minutes
- Alternative time slots provided within the app
- Option to choose a different doctor with shorter wait times

### Status Communication
- Personalized messages based on patient status
- Automatic reminders for patients who need to complete registration
- Post-appointment follow-up and feedback request

## 5. Implementation Details (Code)

The solution includes a Python implementation with the following key classes:

### Doctor Class
- Tracks availability blocks, current queue, and patient history
- Maintains self-learning consultation duration estimates
- Handles patient status tracking when supported
- Calculates capacity based on schedule and average consultation time

### Patient Class
- Stores patient information, status, and wait times
- Implements priority calculation algorithm considering multiple factors
- Tracks notifications sent to the patient
- Provides methods to update status and measure waiting time

### QueueManagementSystem Class
- Manages the overall system with doctors and patients
- Implements intelligent doctor assignment algorithm
- Handles wait time calculations and updates
- Provides notification and communication mechanisms
- Collects and calculates system performance metrics

The priority algorithm balances multiple factors:
- Medical urgency (highest weight)
- Punctuality (rewards patients arriving close to scheduled time)
- Appointment source (slight preference for app/digital appointments)
- Waiting time (gradually increases priority the longer a patient waits)

The system includes metrics tracking to evaluate performance and guide improvements over time.

The code implementation demonstrates a working prototype of this system, showcasing the key components and algorithms that would be used in a production environment.
