AI Internship Assessment #2 - Scenario-Based Assessment

Intelligent Queue Management System for Schedula

Problem Breakdown: Logical Components & Steps

1. Doctor Schedules & Availability

Maintain an up-to-date schedule for 50 doctors, accounting for varied working hours.

Track real-time availability and consultation durations.

Allow flexibility for schedule changes and emergency cases.

2. Patient Arrival & Appointment Handling

Differentiate between scheduled and walk-in patients.

Track real-time check-ins to monitor actual arrival times.

Implement a rescheduling system for no-shows and delayed arrivals.

3. Multi-Channel Appointment Sources

Integrate appointments from IVR, app, WhatsApp, and walk-ins into a unified system.

Avoid duplication of bookings across multiple channels.

Provide patients with confirmation and reminders via their preferred channel.

4. Queue Optimization & Prioritization

Implement dynamic patient assignment based on:

Real-time queue length

Urgency level (emergency vs. routine check-ups)

Doctor availability & preferences (some doctors accept walk-ins, others donâ€™t)

Optimize queue flow to reduce patient wait times and improve efficiency.

5. Patient Status Tracking

Track patient status in real-time: "Arrived", "Waiting", "Consulted".

Enable doctors to update patient status to ensure smooth queue movement.

Provide a dashboard for staff to monitor queue flow and make adjustments.

Required Information for Intelligent Queuing

To make efficient queuing decisions, the system must track:

âœ… Doctorâ€™s live schedule & consultation durations.
âœ… Real-time patient check-ins & arrival patterns.
âœ… Historical data to predict peak load times.
âœ… Channel-wise appointment booking trends.
âœ… Doctor-specific queue preferences (walk-in acceptance, appointment slots, etc.).

Measuring System Effectiveness

ðŸ“‰ Average Wait Time Reduction â€“ Compare patient wait times before and after implementation.
ðŸ“Š Queue Efficiency Score â€“ Track how many patients are served per doctor per time block.
ðŸ’¬ Patient Satisfaction Metrics â€“ Collect feedback through app/SMS to evaluate patient experience.
ðŸ“Œ No-Show & Walk-In Handling â€“ Measure how well the system accommodates last-minute changes.

Patient Communication Strategy

ðŸ”¹ Real-time ETA Updates â€“ Send automated SMS/App notifications with estimated wait times.
ðŸ”¹ Rescheduling Option â€“ If wait time exceeds X minutes, suggest alternate slots.
ðŸ”¹ Check-in Confirmation â€“ Notify patients when the doctor is ready to see them.
